    This was back in in the days as far as i remember, spring only started as the trees blossoms and the leaves are started to grow back.
    I was still in elementary school(primary school) when i had my first ghost encounter. I know that many peoiple are skeptical when it comes to sories told by kids as it could only be a fragment
    of there imagination but after this experience, my supernatural experience started to happen more frequently when i was back in the home country.
