    This was back in in the days as far as i remember, spring only started as the trees blossoms and the leaves are started to grow back.
    I was still in elementary school(primary school) when i had my first ghost encounter. I know that many people are skeptical when it comes to stories told by kids as it could only be a fragment
    of their imagination but after this experience, my supernatural experience started to happen more frequently when i was back in the home country.
