<h1>Following...</h1>

<p>
    So our house is quite big back in my country with 5 bedroom, so its quite hard to find someone find someone unless you sneaky follow them.
    As a kid thats what i would do if i want to surprise or scare my mum, i followed her and she entered one of the bedroom. As i entered the same room,
    i find it odd that i cant see my mum anywhere in the room. I thought to myself that there is no way that she would be able to go out the rrom without passing me
    as there is only one way in and out.

    You know as a kid, they would search in odd places and im no different. Since i was still so young and so i thought maybe she realised that i was following her and was going to
    try scare her so she would then hid somehwere in the room. So at the time i searched under the bed, inside the closet and even behind the door but i just couldnt find her anywhere. 
    At that stage i thought it was a bit sure and i told myself that "i was sure i seen mum walk in this room". I had mixed feelings at this stage, feeling a bit conused and a bit scared.
    I sunddenly realised that a full grown woman cant fit in either under the bed or even inside the closet, maybe behind the door but still i would have easily spotted her. So i started screaming 
    around the house calling my mum.
