    So our house is quite big back in my country with 5 bedroomsm, so its quite hard to find someone find someone unless you sneaky follow them.
    As a kid thats what i would do if i want to surprise or scare my mum, i followed her and she entered one of the bedroom. As i entered the same room,
    i find it odd that i cant see my mum anywhere in the room. I thought to myself that there is no way that she would be able to go out the rrom without passing me
    as there is only one way in and out.

    You know as a kid, they would search in odd places and im no different.
