    This was back in in the days as far as i remember, spring only started as the trees blossoms and the leaves are started to grow back.
    I was still in elementary school(primary school) when i had my first ghost encounter. I know that many people are skeptical when it comes to stories told by kids as it could only be a fragment
    of their imagination but after this experience, my supernatural experience started to happen more frequently when i was back in the home country.

    I was on third class or fourth class i think but as i said, this was my very first encounter with whatever it was, i never had thoughts about ghosts or any supernatural as i knew they
    only exist on movies as my mother told me. One day i came home from school and it was about three or four in the afternoon so it was still pretty much bright and sunny outside.
    After I entered the front gate to our house, I saw my mum, well...what i thought was my mom, she was standing a few steps outside our main door.
    I remember calling her i shouter "mummm! Im home" She kept on walking towards inside the house and then towards the bedroom so i thought maybe she didnt hear me

    So when i was outside our front door i removed my shoes, as it was a tradition and anyone could relate that whenever you entered a house you have to take off your shoes
    before entering. So as any kid would do i was planning to surprise my mum since she didnt see me come in from my front gate and she also didnt hear me calling her.
