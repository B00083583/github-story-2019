    I screamed for my mums name for like a few seconds but it felt like an eternity before she came rushing down and opened the door holding a spatula asking me what happened.
    She askjed my why was i screaming and calling her from the room. I didnt know waht to say i literally just stood in front of her for five seconds and ran to her striaght and hug her tight.

    It was just me and my mom in the house by this time as my older sister was still at school and my dad was still at work so it was a big puzzle who or what I followed that day.
