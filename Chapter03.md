    My mom "from the outside of the room" opened the door holding a ladle asking me what had happened. She was asking me why I was screaming and I just ran to her straight and hugged her tight.
    I told her that I was following her from the time I got home and I saw her go inside the room but I wasn't able to find her so I got scared. She told me she was in the kitchen cooking for dinner the entire time and she didn't
    even notice that I already arrived from school.
