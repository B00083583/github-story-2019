    I screamed for my mums name for like a few seconds but it felt like an eternity before she came rushing down and opened the door holding a spatula asking me what happened.
    She asked me why was i screaming and calling her from the room. I didnt know waht to say i literally just stood in front of her for five seconds and ran to her striaght and hug her tight.

    So i explained to her what happened, i told her that i was following her from the time i got home and after i saw her go inside the house and into the room. 
    I told her that when i entered the room i did not find her anywhere. She replied at the time saying she was in the kitchen the whole time making dinner and that she didnt even notice me coming home from school and entered the house.

    It was just me and my mom in the house by this time as my older sister was still at school and my dad was still at work so it was a big puzzle who or what I followed that day.
