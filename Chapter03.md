    My mom "from the outside of the room" opened the door holding a ladle asking me what had happened. She was asking me why I was screaming and I just ran to her straight and hugged her tight.
    I told her that I was following her from the time I got home and I saw her go inside the room but I wasn't able to find her so I got scared. She told me she was in the kitchen cooking for dinner the entire time and she didn't
    even notice that I already arrived from school.

    It was just me and my mom in the house by this time as my older sister was still at school and my dad was still at work so it was a big puzzle who or what I followed that day.
